* Nix fails during building
** elpa packages out of date
   Some of the packages which this derivation tries to download are
   out of date and are not provided at the location searched.

*** Auto-updating use-package
    I would like the package list constructor to automatically search
    of the latest version of a listed package if the version required
    is not specified. Adding functionality for it to search for a
    specific version would be good as well.

    It would be good to implement it in line with the nix philosophy,
    i.e. being able to specify el-packages by their hash or having the
    archive brought in as a flake input


*** have a crack at improving the build stage for the el-packages?
    Matthew Bauer has left a note around the stage which builds all
    the packages to be included with emacs that it is a dirty design
    and they would be up for it being improved.
    Might be worth having a crack?
